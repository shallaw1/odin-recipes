    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are hundreds of ways to make steak pizzaiola, from versions featuring slowly braised tough cuts of beef to quickly seared tenderloin medallions, like I used here. The one thing most people agree on is that you should use really fresh, very sweet, vine-ripened tomatoes. Serve on top of toasted bread with mozzarella cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound beef tenderloin steaks, cut into 4 medallions</li>
        <li>slat and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablesppon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced fesh mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced sweet and hot peppers</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1.4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato concasse(see Recipe Tip for the recipe link)</li>
        <li>2 tablesppon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1  pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season steak medallions with salt and black pepper on both sides. </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add steaks and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Reserve oil in skillet. </li>
        <li>Place mushrooms and butter into the skillet and season with salt; cook and stir until mushrooms are softened and beginning to brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add peppers and cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute. Pour in wine and sprinkle in dried oregano. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until the wine is nearly evaporated, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir tomato concass√© into the mushroom mixture and simmer until tomato is softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add fresh oregano, balsamic vinegar, and red pepper flakes; stir to combine. Adjust salt and black pepper to taste. </li>
        <li>Place steaks back into the skillet with the mushroom mixture and cook until warmed through and cooked to desired doneness, 4 to 10 minutes. </li>
